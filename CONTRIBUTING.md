# 1. Introduction
**Welcome!** First off, thank you for contributing to the further development of Red. We're always looking for new ways to improve our project and we appreciate any help you can give us.

### 1.1 Why do these guidelines exist?
Red is an open source project. This means that each and every one of the developers and contributors who have helped make Red what it is today have done so by volunteering their time and effort. It takes a lot of time to coordinate and organize issues and new features and to review and test pull requests. By following these guidelines you will help the developers streamline the contribution process and save them time. In doing so we hope to get back to each and every issue and pull request in a timely manner.

### 1.2 What kinds of contributions are we looking for?
We love receiving contributions from our community. Any assistance you can provide with regards to bug fixes, feature enhancements, and documentation is more than welcome.

# 2. Ground Rules
1. Ensure all Python features used in contributions exist and work in Python 3.8.1 and above.
2. Create new tests for code you add or bugs you fix. It helps us help you by making sure we don't accidentally break anything :grinning:
3. Create any issues for new features you'd like to implement and explain why this feature is useful to everyone and not just you personally.
4. Don't add new cogs unless specifically given approval in an issue discussing said cog idea.
5. Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# 3. Your First Contribution
Unsure of how to get started contributing to Red? Please take a look at the Issues section of this repo and sort by the following labels:

* beginner - issues that can normally be fixed in just a few lines of code and maybe a test or two.
* help-wanted - issues that are currently unassigned to anyone and may be a bit more involved/complex than issues tagged with beginner.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

At this point you're ready to start making changes. Feel free to ask for help; everyone was a beginner at some point!
